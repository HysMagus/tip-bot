#Tip Bot

Modular tip bot made for multiple chat interfaces, databases, and Ethereum connections.

Config edits to make are at the top of each file.

Discord is functional. Make a Bot User and add it.

Gitter is functional. Make a GitHub account for the bot and then sign that up for Gitter. Use CURL and their API to get Channel IDs.

Slack requires a few edits to main.js so it likely works with oddities right now. It connects with a real user, and unsecured IRC (secured makes a minimal difference).

IRC connects to a not registered nickname. I'll try to add NickServ compatibility later. It's based off slack.js (based off the IRC protocol), so it will also have a few oddities.

Made with the help of 17robots.
